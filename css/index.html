        <h1 class="page-title">Rockstar</h1>
          <p>Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars.
          The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat.
          And we'll hang out in the coolest bars In the VIP with the movie stars.
          Every good gold digger's Gonna wind up there Every Playboy bunny With her bleach blond hair.
          Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar!</p>
